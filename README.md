Implements the Vigenere class. The Vigenere cipher takes a message and encodes it using a key (represented in this class as a string) that is used to determine the number of letters each letter in the message must be shifted.

Documentation for this class is placed in the 'docs/html' folder, and was generated using Doxygen.
